Bugs fixed and a few more changes!
_ _
**Thanks to Favna for**:
⫸ Fixed a bug with reaction roles where the role would not get removed when a custom emoji was used for the reaction role.
⫸ In many places we now started using Discord native timestamps, kind of like how this release was made on <t:1633187327:D>.
⫸ The `country` command has been disabled and removed because the API we were using (restcountries.eu) has become a paid API. We want to add the command back, but we first need to find a good replacement for the data source. If anyone has any recommendations, please let my developers know.
⫸ The message I sent to you when reminding you of a reminder is now clearer and better English.
⫸ When using `gstart` or `gcreate` and providing roles who can participate, I will not mention those roles so they are made aware a giveaway has started for them.
⫸ When you added me to your server with the permissions we request in the invitation she gets a so called "Managed Role", a role that cannot be assigned to other members or manually removed. It is now possible to also ping that role to trigger my commands.

**Thanks to Kyra for**:
⫸ Adding multiplier support to the `dice` command.
　⪢ If you want to roll a d6 but want to get multiple times the result you can use something like `1d6*10`. For more examples see `skyra help dice`.
