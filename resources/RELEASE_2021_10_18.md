Oopsie woopsie we did a ... well it wasn't that bad. Yesterday's release introduced a few oversights and bugs, so we fixed them.

**Thanks to Favna for**:
⫸ Fixing a bug in all "moderation" (such as `ban`, `kick`, `mute`, `restrictAttachments`, etc.) commands that caused them to not trigger properly.
⫸ Fixing a bug in all "channel configuration" (such as `setmodlogs`) commands that caused them to not trigger properly.
⫸ Fixing a bug in all "weeb" (such as `whug`) commands that caused them to not trigger properly.
⫸ Fixing a bug that caused "happy birthday" messages to not ping the user.
⫸ Fixing a bug in the `bunny` command that caused it to not trigger properly.
⫸ Fixing a bug in the `conf` command where I would show a weird confirmation when saving an emoji (i.e. `suggestions.emojis.downvote`).
⫸ Fixing a bug in the `suggest` command causing the suggestion emojis to not get added.
⫸ Fixing a bug that caused reaction triggers to not add the reaction when a custom emoji was set.
