And as another week passes we have some more changes to announce!
_ _
**Thanks to Favna for**:
⫸ Adding various Star Wars commands. Get information on your favourite Star Wars topics!
　⪢ The commands are `star-wars-film`, `star-wars-character`, `star-wars-planet`, `star-wars-ship`, `star-wars-species`, and `star-wars-vehicles`.
　⪢ You can use each to get their respective information.
　⪢ Currently we support information from the first 6 movies, this means no movies 7-9, Rogue One, Solo, or the The Clone Wars, Rebels, Resistance, and The Bad Batch cartoons. These are likely to be added in the future however.
