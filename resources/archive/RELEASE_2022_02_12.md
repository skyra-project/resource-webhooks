How about some release notes again?

**Thanks to Nytelife for**:
⫸ Ensuring users get alerted when they try to claim a reaction role that Skyra cannot assign due to role hierarchy issues.
⫸ Ensuring manual bans are logged to the "ban" logs.

**Thanks to Favna for**:
⫸ Removing the `overwatch`, `clashofclan`, `brawlstars`, and `fortnite` command. This follows our recent announcement and plans for Skyra v7. For more details see [this document](https://skyra.notion.site/skyra/Skyra-v7-922ba06004654142a7b63347a92513a8#8bab29f929394d238b13300730dbb4cd).
⫸ Fixing the `eshop` command failing for games that do not define how many players can play the game.
⫸ Fixing the `ffxiv` command by adding the recently added classes and adding fallbacks if new classes are added in the future.
