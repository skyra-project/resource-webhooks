Little updates that were rolled out yesterday!
_ _
⫸ Fixed a formatting error when using a moderation command with 2 or more users.
⫸ Possibly fixed a bug when creating multiple moderation cases simultaneously, they are now sequentialized.
⫸ Improved the internal handler for very long messages to use a select menu, publicly affects `content`.
⫸ Improved the `help` command's internal code.
⫸ Removed the `Eva` prefix, it was supposed to be an easter egg, but it was abused. `Skyra` still works.

We're also moving our support channel from the classic text one to a forum channel, this will also help separating different topics as Skyra Lounge isn't just for Skyra, but for all of Skyra Project, which includes other bots and even libraries.
