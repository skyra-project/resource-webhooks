Quick notice for the upcoming update.
_ _
As per [Skyra V7 plans](https://skyra.notion.site/Skyra-v7-922ba06004654142a7b63347a92513a8), we will be removing more commands from Skyra next week. And we also made a [detailed changes page](https://skyra.notion.site/Detailed-Changes-46f9f48650734b81b94a41e1788406ff) documenting what will happen with every single individual feature in Skyra.
_ _
That being said, next release will remove the following commands: `8ball`, `how-to-flirt`, `norris`, `peepolove`, `pun`, `lmgtfy`, `nick`, `triggers`, `flip`, `slap`, `upvote`, `vaporwave`, `zalgo`, `emotes`, and `top-invites`.
_ _
The most outstanding change here is the removal of `triggers`, used to create custom command aliases and message reactions. Slash commands don't support the former, and the latter is not a moderation feature.
