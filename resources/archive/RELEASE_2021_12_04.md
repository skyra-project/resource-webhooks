A smaller release to fix some issues!
_ _
**Thanks to Favna for**:
⫸ Fixing the `yarn` command sometimes not returning results, when the users would know it really should've returned a result.
⫸ Fixing the pluralization of many command texts. For example `Roles` in the `whois` command.

**Thanks to Kyra for**:
⫸ Improving the `info` command response.
