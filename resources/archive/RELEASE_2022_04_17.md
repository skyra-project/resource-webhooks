Another week, another update!
_ _
We have cleaned up a lot of Skyra's internal code again a lot more ahead of the [Skyra V7 update](https://skyra.notion.site/Skyra-v7-922ba06004654142a7b63347a92513a8). With this we have also removed a few more modules / commands:
_ _
⫸ We have removed all Pokémon related commands. These have been migrated to [Dragonite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=931264626614763530&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=412317240320) bot for a while now and we have asked people to migrate to that bot. As the commands are now fully removed we implore you to switch to [Dragonite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=931264626614763530&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=412317240320) if you want to keep using Pokemon related commands.
　⪢ The removed commands are: `ability`, `advantage`, `bag`, `dex`, `dexter`, `flavor`, `flavors`, `flavour`, `flavours`, `item`, `learn`, `learnall`, `learnset`, `matchup`, `mon`, `move`, `poke`, `pokeability`, `pokedex`, `pokeimage`, `pokeitem`, `pokemon`, `pokesprite`, `sprite`, `type`, and `weakness`
_ _
⫸ We have removed the `analytics` (a.k.a. `growth`) command. The service this command was using was constantly breaking and we do not have the bandwidth to fix it. If you want to know how many servers Skyra is in you can still use the `info` command.
