Economy and levelling updates!
_ _
As per [Skyra V7 plans](https://skyra.notion.site/Detailed-Changes-46f9f48650734b81b94a41e1788406ff) and yesterday's announcement, we have removed the Economy and Levelling modules from Skyra.
_ _
⫸ Removed the following commands: `balance`, `credits`, `coinflip`, `daily`, `higherlower`, `pay`, `slotmachine`, `vault`, `wheeloffortune`, `autorole`, `social`, `leaderboard`, `level`, `mylevel`, `profile`, `banner`, `setcolor`, `toggledarkmode`, and `reputation`.
⫸ Most likely greatly improved the database driver's stability.
⫸ As announced on <t:1654336646:F> ([message](https://discord.com/channels/254360814063058944/283965220446273547/982583853367590982)), we have fully removed the suggestion module from Skyra. Please use [Iriss](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=948377113457745990&permissions=326417868864&scope=bot%20applications.commands) instead.
_ _
Some of the commands will be available under Nayre's Acryss, but the functionality may not be the same.
_ _
As a reminder from the previous announcement, all data from both modules will be permanently removed from our database, however, local leaderboards will be available for 3 months until <t:1670162400:D> for server owners and administrators to retrieve said data in case they wish to transfer it to another bot.
