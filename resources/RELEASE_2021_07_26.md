⫸ Fixing the auto deleting of greeting messages.
⫸ Adding a new option "media only channels". Configure this to have a channel in which all messages get deleted that do not have an attachment with a media extension (`.bmp`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.gifv`, `.webp`, `.webm`, `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.mp4`, or `.ogg`).
