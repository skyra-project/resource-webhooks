Horoscope update!
_ _
As part of our [Skyra V7 plans](https://skyra.notion.site/Detailed-Changes-46f9f48650734b81b94a41e1788406ff), and last weeks announcement, we have removed the `horoscope` command due to low usage, high maintainability, and most of all, questionable usage legality with how it was getting its data.
_ _
â«¸ Removed the following command: `horoscope`.
_ _
As a reminder from the previous announcement, this command will **not** transfer to any other bot. Instead we recommend inviting [Kitsunetsuki](https://top.gg/bot/315826602187554816) if you want your server to still have a horoscope command.
