More slash command migrations!
_ _
As per [Skyra V7 plans](https://blog.skyra.pw/skyra-v7), we have released Teryl.
_ _
⫸ Deprecated the following commands:
　⪢ `reddit`: A deprecation notice will be included with the responses.
　⪢ `reminder`: The `add` subcommand has been removed, you can still view, list, and delete them.
⫸ Removed the following commands: `choice`, `color`, `content`, `create-emoji`, `define`, `emoji`, `followage`, `poll`, `price`, `twitch`, `urban`, `weather`, `wikipedia`, and `youtube`.
⫸ These commands have all been added to [Teryl](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=948377583626637343&permissions=1074004032&scope=applications.commands%20bot).
　⪢ This time, we include [patch notes](https://blog.skyra.pw/teryl-release) so you know what else did we do to the commands.
_ _
⫸ Moved `skyra-fact` to Ring as `/history`, available only in Skyra Lounge.
⫸ Removed the following commands permanently: `country`, `eshop`, `igdb`, `itunes`, `movies`, and `shows`.
　⪢ They barely saw any usage, and their maintenance cost was very high.
