**Thanks to Kyra for**:
❯ Adding configuration keys `messages.farewell-auto-delete` and `messages.greeting-auto-delete`. If configured then Skyra's greeting and/or farewell messages will be automatically deleted after the given amount of time.
❯ Adding `gn` as an alias for the `good-night` command
❯ Adding `giveaway-end` (also: `gend` or `ge`) command. Use this to close a currently running giveaway (only supports giveaways started by Skyra).
❯ _**Kyra please write down all the afk command changes here**_
❯ _**Kyra please write down all the prune command changes here**_
❯ Fixing how we parse the input argument for the `manage-command-auto-delete` command. The way we claimed it should work in the examples will now actually work.
❯ Adding an overwrite to permission nodes to ensure that server owners and administrators are not affected by permission nodes.

**Thanks to Favna for**:
❯ Dockerizing Skyra! This is an internal change but a great achievement nonetheless.
❯ Fixing errors being thrown related to missing permissions for:
　❯❯ `manage-reaction-rolows show` subcommand, if Skyra was missing the "Embed Links" permission.
　❯❯ `poll` command, if Skyra was missing the "Embed Links" permission.
　❯❯ `help CommandName` (getting help for a specific command), if Skyra was missing either the "Embed Links" or "Read Message History permissions"

**Thanks to Tyler for**:
