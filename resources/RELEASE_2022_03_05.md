Releasing what was announced on <t:1646211743:D>!
_ _
As previously announced on on <t:1646211743:D> we have now fully removed the following functionality from Skyra. For more information on why we made this decision, please read our previously announced plans for Skyra v7 [here](https://skyra.notion.site/Skyra-v7-922ba06004654142a7b63347a92513a8)
_ _
The following modules have now been **removed**:
- AFK
- Announcement
- Birthday
- Giveaway
- Greetings & Farewells
- Relationships (marriages)
- Starboard
_ _
As well as the following commands:
- `currenttime`
- `ffxiv`
- `gimage`
- `gsearch`
- `markov`
- `quote`
- `reddituser`
_ _
That all said, we want to remind you that you should use [Dragonite](https://top.gg/bot/931264626614763530) for the Pokémon commands. Once it has been verified by Discord, the Pokémon commands will be removed from Skyra, however in order to get verified, [Dragonite](https://top.gg/bot/931264626614763530) will first need to grow more, and you can help with this <a:SkyraHappy:735068843407573043>!
