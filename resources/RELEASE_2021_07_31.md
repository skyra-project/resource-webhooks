Periodic releases are good releases!

**Thanks to Favna for**:
⫸ Adding [anilist](https://anilist.co) to the `anime` and `manga` commands. The old [kitsu.io](https://kitsu.io) based commands are now `kitsu-anime` and `kitsu-manga`.
　⪢ [Anilist](https://anilist.co) gives the info in a much cleaner way so we opted to make this the default source of information
⫸ Fixing a bug that caused editing message to commands that only send images caused errors. Sorry about that, he's also to blame for the bug <a:SkyraAngry:735069992068055110>.

**Thanks to Kyra for**:
⫸ Making improvements to all our image/meme commands such as `profile`, `slap` and `triggered` by completely reworking what we use to generate the images.
　⪢ As an example, text in the `profile` is much sharper and easier to read now!

And lastly we would like to mention that we've been working in the background to prepare <@266624760782258186> for being able to support new Discord features such as buttons, slash commands and threads and we're getting ever closer. We cannot promise when we'll release updates with these features, but expect them in the near future.
