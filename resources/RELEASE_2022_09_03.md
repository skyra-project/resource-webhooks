More slash command migrations!
_ _
As per [Skyra V7 plans](https://skyra.notion.site/Detailed-Changes-46f9f48650734b81b94a41e1788406ff), we are removing the Economy and Levelling modules from Skyra on <t:1662300000:D>.
_ _
As we also mentioned, we will **not** transfer the data to any of the other bots, Nayre's Acryss RPG will start from the ground up without giving anybody an advantage for being an early user of Skyra.
_ _
That being said, all data from both modules will be permanently removed from our database, however, local leaderboards will be available for 3 months until <t:1670162400:D> for server owners and administrators to retrieve said data in case they wish to transfer it to another bot.
