Website updates still exist!

Hello all, on <t:1651412427:F> we were informed that [the website](https://skyra.pw) was behaving strangely and most of all the settings dashboard was unavailable to some users. At the time we were unable to provide any solution as the disappearance was without us making any changes, consistent among browsers and users, and completely random.
Today we would like to inform you all that all functionality is back and working again. We are sorry for the inconvenience this may have caused you.
