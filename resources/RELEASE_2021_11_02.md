One small step for ~~man~~ Skyra, one giant leap for ~~mankind~~ awesomeness
_ _
**Thanks to Favna for**:
⫸ Porting all commands that returned paged messages (such as: `help`, `dex`, `gsearch` and many many more) to use Discord Buttons and Select Menu instead of reactions. It's much faster now and works much easier. It also means that Skyra no longer needs the "Manage Messages", "Read Message History" and "Add Reactions" permissions to these commands. This also means that these commands now work in DMs <a:_:735068843407573043>!
⫸ Changing the `youtube` command to use Paginated Messages as well. We were always held back here because we wanted it to work in DMs, but as per the point above that is no longer a problem.

Besides that we have a few announcements to make
1. We are aware that there are various issues in Skyra right now. We're really sorry about all of them, but Skyra's developers <@242043489611808769> and <@268792781713965056> have been extremely busy with work/school, other projects, and just general life stuff around all of that.
2. For our patrons who had access to Aelia, we have changed our donor perks and have a longer form announcement for you, please check it out [here](<https://www.patreon.com/posts/58213983>)!
