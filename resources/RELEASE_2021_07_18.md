Finally a new release!
We're sorry we've been quiet for so, so long. We've been busy with things in our lives outside of development.

**Thanks to Favna for**:
⫸ Fixing a bug that caused some commands responses to not properly update when editing the command message.
⫸ Improving the abort message when aborting the `create-mute` command.
⫸ Renaming the `createMute` command to `create-mute` so now `create-mute` and `createmute` are valid.
⫸ While we hope there aren't any as much possible, we have improved the errors that show up when any do occur.

**Thanks to Kyra for**:
⫸ Adding `--all` as flag  to the `social reset` command. This will reset the levelling points for all members in the server.
⫸ Adding `{user.mention}`, `{author.mention}` and `{member.mention}` as variables to custom commands. These are similar to their respective `{user}`, `{author}` and `{member}` but will also ping the target.
⫸ Adding `def` as alias for the `define` command.
⫸ Adding `hd` as alias for the `history details` command.
⫸ Adding `ho` as alisa for the `history overview` command.
⫸ Fixing permission nodes not updating. They should be functional now.
⫸ Fixing the `lockdown` command sometimes not working when Skyra lacked permissions to apply the lockdown.

**Thanks to Tylertron for**:
⫸ Fixing the message in the `think` command.
