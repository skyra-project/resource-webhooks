2 weeks ago we announced our plans for Skyra v7 (missed it? You can read up on it [here](<https://skyra.notion.site/Skyra-v7-922ba06004654142a7b63347a92513a8>)). One of the key points in these plans were the splitting off Skyra into several bots. One of them being [Dragonite](<https://top.gg/bot/931264626614763530>), which will take over all Pokémon commands of Skyra.
That all said, starting now when using any of the Pokémon commands in Skyra (`ability`, `flavors`, `item`, `learn`, `move`, `pokedex, `sprite` and `type`) you will be reminded to switch to [Dragonite](<https://top.gg/bot/931264626614763530>).

Once [Dragonite](<https://top.gg/bot/931264626614763530>) has been Verified by Discord, the Pokémon commands will be removed from Skyra, however in order to get verified [Dragonite](<https://top.gg/bot/931264626614763530>) will first need to grow more, and you can help with this <a:SkyraHappy:735068843407573043>!
