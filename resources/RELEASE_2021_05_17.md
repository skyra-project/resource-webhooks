Small release because we've been quite busy with other things:
_ _
**Thanks to Kyra for**:
⫸ Adding the `think` command, using [the meme template](https://github.com/skyra-project/skyra/raw/main/assets/images/memes/think.png) from [the TV show Invincible](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/95557-invincible)
⫸ Adding the `where` command, using [the meme template](https://github.com/skyra-project/skyra/raw/main/assets/images/memes/where.png) from [the anime Attack On Titan: The Final Season](https://anilist.co/anime/110277/Shingeki-no-Kyojin-The-Final-Season/)
⫸ Fixing a bug in all moderation commands that made reason a mandatory argument. Now it is optional again.
⫸ Fixing the prompt result in the `marry` command. It's really awkward when you reply no but I interpret yes...
_ _
**Thanks to Favna for**:
⫸ Fixing how we check what the next moderation ID has to be. Previously it could happen that several moderation cases had the same ID, sorry about that.
⫸ Making it possible to get more than 10 results in the `flavor` command.
　⪢ This is for Pokémon like Pikachu which have been with us all our lives.
⫸ Moving the commands in the "Chat Bot Info" subcategory under "General" to the parent "General" category.
