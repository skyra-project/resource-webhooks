Old bugs squashed and a new feature released!
_ _
**Thanks to Favna for**:
⫸ Adding `--back` flag to the `flavor`, `learn`, `pokedex` and `sprite` commands. Use this to get the "back sprite" of the Pokémon, i.e. the sprite you see when you send out the Pokémon. Can be combined with `--shiny` to get the shiny back sprite.
⫸ Fixing a bug with how we initialised scheduled events such as reminders and birthdays. Hopefully they'll be more consistently on time now.
⫸ Fixing the a bug in the `emotes` command giving an error when the server has no custom emotes uploaded.
⫸ Fixing the a bug in the `snipe` command that allowed it to run in "news" channels, where it should not be run.
⫸ Fixing various commands giving errors in DMs to Skyra. In particular `s!help CommandName`, which we often saw going wrong.
