Just a short informative document we have written and wish to share with you.
_ _
On <t:1646490734:D>, we removed Skyra's greeting system as [planned](https://skyra.notion.site/Skyra-v7-922ba06004654142a7b63347a92513a8). However, the community still sought alternatives.

To help with the switch, we have written a document to discuss several kinds greeting systems, their pros, their cons, and their effect in user retention based on our experience. You can read more about it [here](https://skyra.notion.site/Welcome-Systems-eed3a916948f45bb81cbe880e42a3f9b).
