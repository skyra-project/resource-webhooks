New sister in the family!
_ _
As per [Skyra V7 plans](https://skyra.notion.site/Skyra-v7-922ba06004654142a7b63347a92513a8). We have:
_ _
⫸ Removed the `suggest` command as well as all the configuration keys from `suggestions.emojis`. These have been migrated to [Iriss](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=948377113457745990&permissions=326417868864&scope=bot%20applications.commands).
　⪢ The removed options are `suggestions.emojis.downvote` and `suggestions.emojis.upvote`. `suggestions.channel` as well as `suggestions.on-action` are kept for the `resolve-suggestion` command, which will work for the upcomiing months following a soft deprecation.
　⪢ The `resolve-suggestion` command, as well as the rest of the settings, will be removed on <t:1662224400:F>. We want to give everyone a chance to resolve existing suggestions from Skyra in their server, hence the extended period.
_ _
⫸ Released [Iriss](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=948377113457745990&permissions=326417868864&scope=bot%20applications.commands). This bot exclusively uses slash commands, the prefix is `/`.
　⪢ The commands are `config`, `resolve`, and `suggest`.
